/* --idle-pc is mandatory for this game and fails SILENTLY when it breaks.
 *
 * Loop back-edges compile to native gotos, which is worth a measured -11.5% CPU
 * (52.8% of all dispatches were back-edges). But the OS idle spin loop at
 * 0x80185DEC must keep returning to the chassis, or the host never sees the
 * guest go idle and idle-skip stops working -- the symptom is FMV and gameplay
 * running at roughly half speed, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * Nothing checked this. It was verified by hand, by grepping a generated chunk
 * for `label_80185DEC` and eyeballing its back-edge, which is exactly the kind
 * of check that stops happening. So: assert the emitter's two branches
 * directly.
 *
 * ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. emit_set_idle_pc() and emit_add_dispatch_pc() write to
 * static emitter state and there is no way to clear it, so the unprotected case
 * must run FIRST.
