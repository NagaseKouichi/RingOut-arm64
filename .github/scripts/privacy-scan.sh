# can be perfectly free of disc data and still ship the builder's username,
# home directory layout, LAN addressing or a credential. Those come from
# different places than the game files do, so they need their own check:
#
#   * absolute build paths baked into binaries by the compiler or by cmake
#     (-ffile-prefix-map neutralises the compiler's, but generated files,
#     cmake_install.cmake, DartConfiguration.tcl and .cmake caches are NOT
#     covered and have carried /home/<user>/... in this project before)
#   * source shipped for GPL compliance -- a `git format-patch` carries the
#     author's name and email, and a hand-written patch can carry a hardcoded
#     developer path. A REAL instance: ModernGekko-dolphin-local-changes.patch
#     shipped `/home/<user>/Desktop/soulcalibur/work/fmv` as a default.
#   * a working userdata/ copied in wholesale -- Dolphin's config holds a
#     netplay nickname, RetroAchievements credentials, ISO paths and logs.

# this script lives means the check works on any machine that cuts a release,
