; Ring Out - Ver 1.0 : Windows installer (Inno Setup)
;
; Built by .github/scripts/package-windows.ps1 on the CI runner.
;
; PrivilegesRequired=lowest is deliberate and load-bearing. Ring Out recompiles
; the game from the user's own disc INTO ITS OWN FOLDER -- setup.ps1 writes
; game/, work/ and bin/g<ID>_recomp.dll there, and the runtime writes userdata/.
; A machine-wide install under Program Files is read-only for a normal user, so
; first-run setup would fail. "lowest" resolves {autopf} to the per-user
; Programs folder, which is writable.

#define AppName    "Ring Out"
; Overridden by package-windows.ps1 with /DAppVersion=<VERSION>. The value
; here is only a fallback for compiling this script by hand -- the packaged
; installer takes its version from the repo's VERSION file, so the filename
; and the Add/Remove Programs entry cannot disagree with what was built.

; StageDir comes from package-windows.ps1 (/DStageDir), for the same reason
; AppVersion does: the staging directory is named from VERSION, so a literal
; "RingOut-1.0" here silently stops matching the moment the version moves.
; That is exactly what happened -- ISCC failed with "No files found matching
; ...\RingOut-1.0\*" after the stage became RingOut-1.5.2.

WelcomeLabel2=This will install {#AppName} {#AppVersion} on your computer.%n%nNo game data is included. After installing, you supply a GameCube disc image you already own, and it is extracted and recompiled on this machine -- that step takes several minutes and needs about 1.5 GB of free space.
